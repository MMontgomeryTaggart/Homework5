\subsection{Algorithm Implementation}
All of the algorithms were implemented using python2.7. The feature matrices were represented using sci-kit's csrmatrix() class to minimize the memory footprint and the number of cpu-operations required for each matrix-vector operation.\\
Each model was represented using a python class implementing a fit() and predict() method similar to sci-kit learn's API. Cross validation splits were generated using sci-kit learn's StratifiedKFold class with the random state fixed at 0. The grid search was executed using simple nested for-loops where the parameters that produced the top average accuracy were maintained and used to re-fit the model on the whole training set.\\
The number of training epochs for the SVM and logistic regression models was selected as 3 after evaluating the performance for epochs in the range 1-5.
